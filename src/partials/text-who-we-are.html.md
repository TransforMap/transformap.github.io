Today there is no single resource to easily identify and directly benefit from transformative social innovations, either in your neighborhood or globally. While a new economy based on horizontal collaboration for the common good is emerging with the mushrooming of practices like sharing, [repairing](http://therestartproject.org/), [bartering](https://www.makerfox.com/), co-producing, co-using, [commoning](http://commonstransition.org/), and [Transition](https://www.transitionnetwork.org/) initiatives, it is extremely hard to get an overview of this global transformation.

TransforMap is a collaborative answer to this challenge and its complexities. It aims to co-develop with users - common citizens as well as representatives of the different movements - the necessary tools and standards for free and open crowd mapping and aggregating all such initiatives in one mapping tool that can be navigated by neophytes. TransforMap is being developed by, and offers the opportunity to display, *all* initiatives that belong to communities of practice approved by the [wider TransforMap community](http://discourse.transformap.co/c/welcome-on-board/who-is-who).

A longer introduction to organization's history and collaboration can be read on the [TransforMap Discourse forum](http://discourse.transformap.co/t/transformap-a-not-so-short-introduction/239).
